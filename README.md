# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

TODO: Write a project description
Lab 09 has us creating a web browser game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (mostly JavaScript).
We use a variety of techniques and methods to create functions and classes that create and draw multi-colored
bouncy balls that move around the screen and bounce back after touching any edges of the screen. We then create
another class that creates a user-controlled ball that "eats" the other bouncy balls when a collision occurs
between them.


## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.
