# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

Lab 09 has us creating a web browser game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (mostly JavaScript).
We use a variety of techniques and methods to create functions and classes that create and draw multi-colored
bouncy balls that move around the screen and bounce back after touching any edges of the screen. We then create
another class that creates a user-controlled ball that "eats" the other bouncy balls when a collision occurs
between them.
